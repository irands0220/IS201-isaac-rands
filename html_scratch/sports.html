                    <li>I had a lot of injuries, including multiple concussions and a torn labrum. You'll see as such in the video</li>
                    <li>The video to the right is a video of me getting wrecked by my opponent</li>

                    <li>I have not played a lick of high school or junior high basketball.</li>
                    <li>But I have put a lot of hours in starting my senior year of high school in the church gym with my friends</li>
                    <li>So my level of basketball is playing in intramurals and watching byu play</li>

                    <li>So I played it every day right outside of my Heritage 15 building, and now I play it in intramurals</li>
